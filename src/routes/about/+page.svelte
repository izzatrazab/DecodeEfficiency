  <h1>About this app</h1>

  <p>
    Hi, I'm a fellow Svelte lover. This website is a collection of mini
    applications that I built using SvelteKit to improve my skills on using it.
    At the moment there is no single application yet.
  </p>
  <p>My first svelte mini application would be a typing test application.</p>
