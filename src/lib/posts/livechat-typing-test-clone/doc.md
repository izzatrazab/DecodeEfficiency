# Introduction

In this documentation, I will show you how I clone a typing speed test by [LiveChat](https://www.livechat.com/typing-speed-test/#/ "go to LiveChat typing speed test page"). I will divide this project to manageable chunks so it is easier to understand. I hope you will learn something out of this. Enjoy ðŸ¥³.

Screenshot below is the original application.

I used __Sveltekit__ (javascript framework) and __Pico CSS__ for the styles (note: demo above used Pico CSS but with slight modification, which I will not cover in this documentation as it is so small and does not changes much). 

# Setup

1. Scaffold your Sveltekit project. Refer [here](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/creating-a-project 'go to official documentation on how to scaffold a sveltekit project') if you don't know how. 

2. Install [Pico CSS](https://picocss.com/docs/ 'go to Pico CSS documentation').

```shell
npm install @picocss/pico
```

3. Install  [random-words](https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-words?activeTab=readme 'go to random-words page by npmjs') package. This package will provide list of random words to be typed. In your terminal:

```shell
npm install random-words
```
